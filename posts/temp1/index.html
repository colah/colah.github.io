<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A lot of problems in machine learning are about trying to learn a function on a high-dimensional space. We have a set of data points for which we know what value the function should take. For example, we might be trying to classify images – which we can interpret as vectors – given a set of images for which we know their classes.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following 2-dimensional points. The are in two classes, red and blue. If we had an unknown point somewhere on the plane, which class should that be?</p>
<div class="centerimgcontainer">
<img src="img/ex1-points.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>One option would be to go with the class of the closest known point. (This is a very simple version of a technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm">nearest neighbors</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="one-hidden-layer-neural-networks">One Hidden Layer Neural Networks</h2>
<p>A neural network with a hidden layer has universality: given enough hidden units, it can approximate any function. This is a frequently quoted – and even more frequently, misunderstood and applied – theorem.</p>
<p>It’s true, essentially, because the hidden layer can be used as a lookup table.</p>
<p>For simplicity, let’s consider a perceptron network. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">perceptron</a> is a very simple neuron that fires if it exceeds a certain threshold and doesn’t fire if it doesn’t reach that threshold. A perceptron network gets binary (0 and 1) inputs and gives binary outputs.</p>
<div class="floatrightimgcontainer">
<img src="img/flowchart-PerceptronLookup.png" alt style>
</div>
<p>Note that there are only a finite number of possible inputs. For each possible input, we can construct a neuron in the hidden layer that fires for that input, and only on that specific input. Then we can use the connections between that neuron and the output neurons to control the output in that specific case.</p>
<p>Constructing a case for every possible input requires <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span> hidden neurons, when you have <span class="math">\(n\)</span> input neurons. In reality, the situation isn’t usually that bad. You can have cases that encompass multiple inputs. And you have can have overlapping cases that add together to achieve the right input on their intersection.</p>
<p>(It isn’t only perceptron networks that have universality. Networks of sigmoid neurons (and other activation functions) are also universal: give enough hidden neurons, they can approximate any continuous function arbitrarily well. Seeing this is significantly trickier because you can’t just isolate inputs.)</p>
<p>And so, it’s true that one hidden layer neural networks are universal. But there isn’t anything particularly impressive or exciting about that. Saying that your model can do the same thing as a lookup table isn’t a very strong argument for it. You’re just saying it isn’t literally impossible for your model to do the task.</p>
<p>Universality means that a network can fit to any training data you give it. It doesn’t mean that it will interpolate to new data points in a reasonable way.</p>
<p>There seems, in fact, to be something very powerful about neural networks. But it’s much more subtle than universality and it seems to require networks with many layers.</p>
<h2 id="word-embeddings">Word Embeddings</h2>
<p>I’d like to change courses for a minute and trace a particularly interesting strand of deep learning research: word embeddings. In my personal opinion, word embeddings are probably the most exciting area of research in deep learning at the moment. Beyond that, I think they are one of the best places to gain intuition about why deep learning is so effective.</p>
<p>A word embedding <span class="math">\(W: \mathrm{words} \to \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is a paramaterized function mapping words in some language to high-dimensional vectors (perhaps 200 to 500 dimensions). For example, we might find:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[W(``\text{cat}\!&quot;) = (0.2,~ \text{-}0.4,~ 0.7,~ ...)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[W(``\text{mat}\!&quot;) = (0.0,~ 0.6,~ \text{-}0.1,~ ...)\]</span></p>
<p>(Typically, the function is a lookup table, parameterized by a matrix, <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>, with a row for each word: <span class="math">\(W_\theta(w_n) = \theta_n\)</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="math">\(W\)</span> is initialized to have random vectors for each word. It learns to have meaningful vectors in order to perform some task.</p>
<p>For example, one task we might train a network for is predicting whether a 5-gram (sequence of five words) is ‘valid.’ We can easily get lots of 5-grams from Wikipedia (eg. “cat sat on the mat”) and then ‘break’ half of them by switching a word with a random word (eg. “cat sat <strong>song</strong> the mat”), since that will almost certainly make our 5-gram nonsensical.</p>
<div class="floatrightimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Bottou-WordSetup.png" alt style>
<div class="caption">
Modular Network to determine if a 5-gram is ‘valid’ (From <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.1808v3.pdf">Bottou (2011)</a>)
</div>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>The model we train will run each word in the 5-gram through <span class="math">\(W\)</span> to get a vector representing it and feed those into another ‘module’ called <span class="math">\(R\)</span> which tries to predict if the 5-gram is ‘valid’ or ‘broken.’ Then, we’d like:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[R(W(``\text{cat}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{sat}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{on}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{the}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{mat}\!&quot;)) = 1\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[R(W(``\text{cat}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{sat}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{song}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{the}\!&quot;),~ W(``\text{mat}\!&quot;)) = 0\]</span></p>
<p>In order to predict these values accurately, the network needs to learn good parameters for both <span class="math">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, this task isn’t terribly interesting. Maybe it could be helpful in detecting grammatical errors in text or something. But what is extremely interesting is <span class="math">\(W\)</span>.</p>
<p>(In fact, to us, the entire point of the task is to learn <span class="math">\(W\)</span>. We could have done several other tasks – another common one is predicting the next word in the sentence. But we don’t really care. In the remainder of this section we will talk about many word embedding results and won’t distinguish between different approaches.)</p>
<p>One thing we can do to get a feel for the word embedding space is to visualize them with t-SNE, a sophisticated technique for visualizing high-dimensional data.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Turian-WordTSNE.png" alt style>

</div>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>This kind of ‘map’ of words makes a lot of intuitive sense to us. Similar words are close together. Another way to get at this is to look at which words are closest in the embedding to a given word. Again, the words tend to be quite similar.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Colbert-WordTable2.png" alt style>
<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>It seems natural for a network to make words with similar meanings have similar vectors. If you switch a word for a synonym (eg. “a few people sing well” <span class="math">\(\to\)</span> “a <em>couple</em> people sing well”), the validity of the sentence doesn’t change. While, from a naive perspective, the input sentence has changed a lot, if <span class="math">\(W\)</span> maps synonyms (like “few” and “couple”) close together, from <span class="math">\(R\)</span>’s perspective little changes.</p>
<p>This is very powerful. The number of possible 5-grams is massive and we have a comparatively small number of data points to try to learn from. Similar words being close together allows us to generalize from one sentence to a class of similar sentences. This doesn’t just mean switching a word for a synonym, but also switching a word for a word in a similar class (eg. “the wall is blue” <span class="math">\(\to\)</span> “the wall is <em>red</em>”). Further, we can change multiple words (eg. “the wall is blue” <span class="math">\(\to\)</span> “the <em>ceiling</em> is <em>red</em>”). The impact of this is exponential with respect to the number of words.</p>
<p>So, clearly this is a very useful thing for <span class="math">\(W\)</span> to do. But how does it learn to do this? It seems quite likely that there are lots of situations where it has seen a sentence like “the wall is blue” and know that it is valid before it sees a sentence like “the wall is red”. As such, shifting “red” a bit closer to “blue” makes the network perform better.</p>
<p>We still need to see examples of every word being used, but the analogies allow us to generalize to new combinations of words. You’ve seen all the words that you understand before, but you haven’t seen all the sentences that you understand before. So too with neural networks.</p>
<div class="floatrightimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Mikolov-GenderVecs.png" alt style>
<div class="caption">
From <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N13/N13-1090.pdf">Mikolov <em>et al.</em> (2013a)</a>
</div>
</div>
<p>Word embeddings exhibit an even more remarkable property: analogies between words seem to be encoded in the difference vectors between words. For example, there seems to be a constant male-female difference vector:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[W(``\text{woman}\!&quot;) - W(``\text{man}\!&quot;) ~\simeq~ W(``\text{aunt}\!&quot;) - W(``\text{uncle}\!&quot;)\]</span> <span class="math">\[W(``\text{woman}\!&quot;) - W(``\text{man}\!&quot;) ~\simeq~ W(``\text{queen}\!&quot;) - W(``\text{king}\!&quot;)\]</span></p>
<p>This may not seem too surprising. After all, gender pronouns mean that switching a word can make a sentence grammatically incorrect. You write, “<em>she</em> is the aunt” but “<em>he</em> is the uncle.” Similarly, “<em>he</em> is the King” but “<em>she</em> is the Queen.” If one sees “<em>she</em> is the <em>uncle</em>,” the most likely explanation is a grammatical error. If words are being randomly switched half the time, it seems pretty likely that happened here.</p>
<p>“Of course!” We say with hindsight, “the word embedding will learn to encode gender in a consistent way. In fact, there’s probably a gender dimension. Same thing for singular vs plural. It’s easy to find these trivial relationships!”</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that much more sophisticated relationships are also encoded in this way. It seems almost miraculous!</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">

</div>
<p>It’s important to appreciate that all of these properties of <span class="math">\(W\)</span> are <em>side effects</em>. We didn’t try to have similar words be close together. We didn’t try to have analogies encoded with difference vectors. All we tried to do was perform a simple task, like predicting whether a sentence was valid. These properties more or less popped out of the optimization process.</p>
<p>This seems to be a great strength of neural networks: they learn better ways to represent data, automatically. Representing data well, in turn, seems to be essential to success at many machine learning problems. Word embeddings are just a particularly striking example of learning a representation.</p>
<h2 id="shared-representations">Shared Representations</h2>
<p>The properties of word embeddings are certainly interesting, but can we do anything useful with them? Besides predicting silly things, like whether a 5-gram is ‘valid’?</p>
<div class="floatrightimgcontainer">

<div class="caption">
<span class="math">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> learn to perform task A. Later, <span class="math">\(G\)</span> can learn to perform B based on <span class="math">\(W\)</span>.
</div>
</div>
<p>We learned the word embedding in order to do well on a simple task, but based on the nice properties we’ve observed in word embeddings, you may suspect that they could be generally useful in NLP tasks. In fact, word representations like these are extremely important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of word representations… has become a key “secret sauce” for the success of many NLP systems in recent years, across tasks including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and semantic role labeling. (<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/~lmthang/data/papers/conll13_morpho.pdf">Luong <em>et al.</em> (2013)</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This general tactic – learning a good representation on a task A and then using it on a task B – is one of the major tricks in the Deep Learning toolbox. It goes by different names depending on the details: pretraining, transfer learning, and multi-task learning. One of the great strengths of this approach is that it allows the representation to learn from more than one kind of data.</p>
<p>There’s a counterpart to this trick. Instead of learning a way to represent one kind of data and using it to perform multiple kinds of tasks, we can learn a way to map multiple kinds of data into a single representation!</p>
<p>One nice example of this is a bilingual word-embedding, produced in <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~wzou/emnlp2013_ZouSocherCerManning.pdf">Socher <em>et al.</em> (2013a)</a>. We can learn to embed words from two different languages in a single, shared space. In this case, we learn to embed English and Mandarin Chinese words in the same space.</p>
<div class="floatrightimgcontainer">
<img src="img/flowchart-billingual.png" alt style>
</div>
<p>We train two word embeddings, <span class="math">\(W_{en}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(W_{zh}\)</span> in a manner similar to how we did above. However, we know that certain English words and Chinese words have similar meanings. So, we optimize for an additional property: words that we know are close translations should be close together.</p>
<p>Of course, we observe that the words we knew had similar meanings end up close together. Since we optimized for that, it’s not surprising. More interesting is that words we <em>didn’t know</em> were translations end up close together.</p>
<p>In light of our previous experiences with word embeddings, this may not seem too surprising. Word embeddings pull similar words together, so if an English and Chinese word we know to mean similar things are near each other, their synonyms will also end up near each other. We also know that things like gender differences tend to end up being represented with a constant difference vector. It seems like forcing enough points to line up should force these difference vectors to be the same in both the English and Chinese embeddings. A result of this would be that if we know that two male versions of words translate to each other, we should also get the female words to translate to each other.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it feels a bit like the two languages have a similar ‘shape’ and that by forcing them to line up at different points, they overlap and other points get pulled into the right positions.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In billingual word embeddings, we learn a shared representation for two very similar kinds of data. But we can also learn to embed very different kinds of data in the same space.</p>
<div class="floatrightimgcontainer">
<img src="img/flowchart-DeViSE.png" alt style>
</div>
<p>Recently, deep learning has begun exploring models that embed images and words in a single representation.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The basic idea is that one classifies images by outputting a vector in a word embedding. Images of dogs are mapped near the “dog” word vector. Images of horses are mapped near the “horse” vector. Images of automobiles near the “automobile” vector. And so on.</p>
<p>The interesting part is what happens when you test the model on new classes of images. For example, if the model wasn’t trained to classify cats – that is, to map them near the “cat” vector – what happens when we try to classify images of cats?</p>
<div class="centerimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Socher-ImageClassManifold.png" alt style>
<div class="caption">
(<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/SocherGanjooManningNg_NIPS2013.pdf">Socher <em>et al.</em> (2013b)</a>)
</div>
</div>
<p>It turns out that the network is able to handle these new classes of images quite reasonably. Images of cats aren’t mapped to random points in the word embedding space. Instead, they tend to be mapped to the general vicinity of the “dog” vector, and, in fact, close to the “cat” vector. Similarly, the truck images end up relatively close to the “truck” vector, which is near the related “automobile” vector.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">

<div class="caption">
(<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/SocherGanjooManningNg_NIPS2013.pdf">Socher <em>et al.</em> (2013b)</a>)
</div>
</div>
<p>This was done by members of the Stanford group with only 8 known classes (and 2 unknown classes). The results are already quite impressive. But with so few known classes, there are very few points to interpolate the relationship between images and semantic space off of.</p>
<!-- (from KSH)?? -->

<p>The Google group did a much larger version – instead of 8 categories, they used 1,000 – around the same time (<a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41473.pdf">Frome <em>et al.</em> (2013)</a>) and has followed up with a new variation (<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5650.pdf">Norouzi <em>et al.</em> (2014)</a>). Both are based on an very powerful image classification model (from <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf">Krizehvsky <em>et al.</em> (2012)</a>), but embed images into the word embedding space in different ways.</p>
<p>The results are impressive. While they may not get images of unknown classes to the precise vector representing that class, they are able to get to the right neighborhood. So, if you ask it to classify images of unknown classes and the classes are fairly different, it can distinguish between the different classes.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve never seen a Aesculapian snake or an Armadillo before, if you show me a picture of one and a picture of the other, I can tell you which is which because I have a general idea of what sort of animal is associated with each word. These networks can accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p><em>(These results all exploit a sort of “these words are similar” reasoning. But it seems like much stronger results should be possible based on relationships between words. In our word embedding space, there is a consistent difference vector between male and female version of words. Similarly, in image space, there are consistent features distinguishing between male and female. Beards, mustaches, and baldness are all strong, highly visible indicators of being male. Breasts and, less reliably, long hair, makeup and jewelery, are obvious indicators of being female.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Even if you’ve never seen a king before, if the queen, determined to be such by the presence of a crown, suddenly has a beard, it’s pretty reasonable to give the male version.)</em></p>
<p>Shared embeddings are an extremely exciting area of research and drive at why the representation focused perspective of deep learning is so compelling.</p>

<p>We began our discussion of word embeddings with the following network:</p>

<p>The above diagram represents a <em>modular</em> network, <span class="math">\(R(W(w_1),~ W(w_2),~ W(w_3),~ W(w_4),~ W(w_5))\)</span>. It is built from two modules, <span class="math">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math">\(R\)</span>. This approach, of building neural networks from smaller neural network “modules” that can be composed together, is not very wide spread. It has, however, been very successful in NLP.</p>
<p>Models like the above are powerful, but they have an unfortunate limitation: they can only have a fixed number of inputs.</p>
<p>We can overcome this by adding an association module, <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, which will take two word or phrase representations and merge them.</p>

<p>By merging sequences of words, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> takes us from representing words to representing phrases or even representing whole <em>sentences</em>! And because we can merge together different numbers of words, we don’t have to have a fixed number of inputs.</p>
<p>It doesn’t necessarily make sense to merge together words in a sentence linearly. If one considers the phrase “the cat sat on the mat”, it can naturally be bracketed into segments: “((the cat) (sat (on (the mat))”. We can apply <span class="math">\(A\)</span> based on this bracketing:</p>

</div>
<p>These models are often called “recursive neural networks” because one often has the output of a module go into a module of the same type. They are also sometimes called “tree-structured neural networks.”</p>
<p>Recursive neural networks have had significant successes in a number of NLP tasks. For example, <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf">Socher <em>et al.</em> (2013c)</a> uses a recursive neural network to predict sentence sentiment:</p>

</div>
<p>One major goal has been to create a <em>reversible</em> sentence representation, a representation that one can reconstruct an actual sentence from, with roughly the same meaning. For example, we can try to introduce a disassociation module, <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, that tries to undo <span class="math">\(A\)</span>:</p>

<p>If we could accomplish such a thing, it would be an extremely powerful tool. For example, we could try to make a bilingual sentence representation and use it for translation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this turns out to be very difficult. Very very difficult. And given the tremendous promise, there are lots of people working on it.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v1.pdf">Cho <em>et al.</em> (2014)</a> have made some progress on representing phrases, with a model that can encode English phrases and decode them in French. Look at the phrase representations it learns!</p>

<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>In the last few years, deep neural networks have lead to breakthrough results on a variety of pattern recognition problems, such as computer vision and voice recognition. One of the essential components leading to these results has been a special kind of neural network called a <em>convolutional neural network</em>.</p>
<p>At it’s most basic, convolutional neural networks can be thought of as a kind of neural network that uses many identical copies of the same neuron. This allows the network to have lots of neurons and express computationally large models while keeping the number of actual parameters – the values describing how neurons behave – that need to be learned fairly small.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv2-9x5-Conv2Conv2.png" alt style>
<div class="caption">
A 2D Convolutional Neural Network
</div>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>This trick of having multiple copies of the same neuron is roughly analogous to the abstraction of functions in mathematics and computer science. When programming, we write a function once and use it in many places – not writing the same code a hundred times in different places makes it faster to program, and results in fewer bugs. Similarly, a convolutional neural network can learn a neuron once and use it in many places, making it easier to learn the model and reducing error.</p>
<p>(It should be noted that not all neural networks that use multiple copies of the same neuron are convolutional neural networks. Convolutional neural networks are just one type of neural network that uses the more general trick, <em>weight-tying</em>. Other kinds of neural network that do this are recurrent neural networks and recursive neural networks.)</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-convolutional-neural-networks">Structure of Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
<p>Suppose you want a neural network to look at audio samples and predict whether a human is speaking or not. Maybe you want to do more analysis if someone is speaking.</p>
<p>You get audio samples at different points in time. The samples are evenly spaced.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv-9-xs.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>The simplest way to try and classify them with a neural network is to just connect them all to a fully-connected layer. There are a bunch of different neurons, and every input connects to every neuron.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv-9-F.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>A more sophisticated approach notices a kind of <em>symmetry</em> in the properties it’s useful to look for in the data. We care a lot about local properties of the data: What frequency of sounds are there around a given time? Are they increasing or decreasing? And so on.</p>
<p>We care about the same properties at all points in time. It’s useful to know the frequencies at the beginning, and also useful to know the frequencies at the end. And again, these are local properties, in that we only need to look at a small window of the audio sample in order to determine them.</p>
<p>So, we can create a group of neurons, <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, that look at small time segments of our data. A looks at all such segments, computing certain <em>features</em>. Then, the output of this <em>convolutional layer</em> is fed into a fully-connected layer, <span class="math">\(F\)</span>.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv-9-Conv2.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>In the above example, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> only looked at segments consisting of two points. This isn’t realistic. Usually, a convolution layer’s window would be much larger.</p>
<p>In the following example, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> looks at 3 points. That isn’t realistic either – sadly, it’s tricky to visualize <span class="math">\(A\)</span> connecting to lots of points.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv-9-Conv3.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>One very nice property of convolutional layers is that they’re composable. You can feed the output of one convolutional layer into another. With each layer, the network can detect higher-level, more abstract features.</p>
<p>In the following example, we have a new group of neurons, <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is used to create another convolutional layer stacked on top of the previous one.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv-9-Conv2Conv2.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>Convolutional layers are often interweaved with pooling layers. In particular, there is a kind of layer called a max-pooling layer that is extremely popular.</p>
<p>Often, from a high level perspective, we don’t care about the precise point in time a feature is present. If a shift in frequency occurs slightly earlier or later, does it matter?</p>
<p>A max-pooling layer takes the maximum of features over small blocks of a previous layer. The output tells us that a feature was present in a region of the previous layer, but not precisely where.</p>
<p>Max-pooling layers kind of “zoom out”. They allow later convolutional layers to work on larger sections of the data, because a small patch in the output corresponds to a larger patch before the layer. They also make us invariant to some very small transformations of the data.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">

<div class="spaceafterimg">

<div class="floatrightimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv2-unit.png" alt style>
</div>
<p>In our previous examples, we’ve used 1-dimensional convolutional layers. However, convolutional layers can work on higher-dimensional data as well. In fact, the most famous successes of convolutional neural networks are applying 2D convolutional neural networks to recognizing images.</p>
<p>In a two-dimensional network, instead of looking at segments, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> will now look at patches.</p>
<p>For each patch, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> will compute features. For example, it might learn to detect the presence of an edge. Or it might learn to detect a texture. Or perhaps a contrast between two colors.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv2-9x5-Conv2.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>In the previous example, we fed the output of our convolutional layer into a fully-connected layer. But we can also compose two convolutional layers, as we did in the one dimensional case.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv2-9x5-Conv2Conv2.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>We can also do max pooling in two dimensions. Here, we take the maximum of features over a small patch.</p>
<p>What this really boils down to is that, when considering an entire image, we don’t care about the exact position of an edge, down to a pixel. It’s enough to know where it is to within a few pixels.</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv2-9x5-Conv2Max2Conv2.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>Three-dimensional convolutional networks are also sometimes used, for data like videos or volumetric data (eg. 3D medical scans). However, they are not very widely used, and much harder to visualize.</p>
<p>Now, we previously said that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> was a group of neurons. We should be a bit more precise about this: what is <span class="math">\(A\)</span> exactly?</p>
<p>In traditional convolutional layers, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a bunch of neurons in parallel, that all get the same inputs and compute different features.</p>
<p>For example, in a 2-dimensional convolutional layer, one neuron might detect horizontal edges, another might detect vertical edges, and another might detect green-red color contrasts.</p>
<div class="centerimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv-A.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>That said, in the recent paper ‘Network in Network’ (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400">Lin <em>et al.</em> (2013)</a>), a new “Mlpconv” layer is proposed. In this model, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> would have multiple layers of neurons, with the final layer outputting higher level features for the region. In the paper, the model achieves some very impressive results, setting new state of the art on a number of benchmark datasets.</p>
<div class="centerimgcontainer">

<p>That said, for the purposes of this post, we will focus on standard convolutional layers. There’s already enough for us to consider there!</p>
<h2 id="results-of-convolutional-neural-networks">Results of Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
<h2 id="formalizing-convolutional-neural-networks">Formalizing Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
<p>Consider a 1-dimensional convolutional layer with inputs <span class="math">\(\{x_n\}\)</span> and outputs <span class="math">\(\{y_n\}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="bigcenterimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv-9-Conv2-XY.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>It’s relatively easy to describe the outputs in terms of the inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_n = A(x_{n}, x_{n+1}, ...)\]</span></p>
<p>For example, in the above:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_0 = A(x_0, x_1)\]</span> <span class="math">\[y_1 = A(x_1, x_2)\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, if we consider a 2-dimensional convolutional layer, with inputs <span class="math">\(\{x_{n,m}\}\)</span> and outputs <span class="math">\(\{y_{n,m}\}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="centerimgcontainer">
<img src="img/Conv2-5x5-Conv2-XY.png" alt style>
</div>
<div class="spaceafterimg">

</div>
<p>We can, again, write down the outputs in terms of the inputs:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_{n,m} = A\left(\begin{array}{ccc} x_{n,~m}, &amp; x_{n+1,~m},&amp; ...,~\\ x_{n,~m+1}, &amp; x_{n+1,~m+1}, &amp; ..., ~\\ &amp;...\\\end{array}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_{0,0} = A\left(\begin{array}{cc} x_{0,~0}, &amp; x_{1,~0},~\\ x_{0,~1}, &amp; x_{1,~1}~\\\end{array}\right)\]</span> <span class="math">\[y_{1,0} = A\left(\begin{array}{cc} x_{1,~0}, &amp; x_{2,~0},~\\ x_{1,~1}, &amp; x_{2,~1}~\\\end{array}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>If one combines this with the equation for <span class="math">\(A(x)\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math">\[A(x) = \sigma(Wx + b)\]</span></p>
<p>one has everything they need to implement a convolutional neural network, at least in theory.</p>
<p>In practice, this is often not the best way to think about convolutional neural networks. There is an alternative formulation, in terms of a mathematical operation called <em>convolution</em>, that is often more helpful.</p>
<p>The convolution operation is a powerful tool. In mathematics, it comes up in diverse contexts, ranging from the study of partial differential equations to probability theory. In part because of its role in PDEs, convolution is very important in the physical sciences. It also has an important role in many applied areas, like computer graphics and signal processing.</p>
<p>For us, convolution will provide a number of benefits. Firstly, it will allow us to create much more efficient implementations of convolutional layers than the naive perspective might suggest. Secondly, it will remove a lot of messiness from our formulation, handling all the bookkeeping presently showing up in the indexing of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>s – the present formulation may not seem messy yet, but that’s only because we haven’t got into the tricky cases yet. Finally, convolution will give us a significantly different perspective for reasoning about convolutional layers.</p>
