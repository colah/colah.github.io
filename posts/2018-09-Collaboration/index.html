  <p></p>


  <p>A lot of the best research in machine learning comes from collaborations. In fact, many of the most significant papers in the last few years (TensorFlow, AlphaGo, etc) come from collaborations of 20+ people.</p>

  <p>When people work together, it’s easy to have conflict -- especially around credit. This can easily turn into hurt feelings and damage collaborations. To avoid this, it’s not enough to avoid academic misappropriation or not giving credit. We should aim to avoid any <i>feeling or appearance</i> of misappropriation as well, if we want to foster a healthy environment for collaborations.</p>

  <p>It’s especially important for us to be mindful of credit issues, because they can easily be perceived as, and likely often are,  linked to privilege or power gradients. This might be gender or race, but it can also be things like being a remote collaborator (ie. geographically removed from others), being an engineer or designer instead of a researcher, or being at a lower level professionally. A perception that diverse or junior collaborators are taken advantage of is deeply toxic.</p>

  <p>The theory of this document is that it’s easier to agree upon general principles, independent of particular situations. Then, when a particular problem arises, you can talk about it in the context of these more general principles.</p>

  <p>This document reflects my personal working principles. This is a hard problem, and I don’t think these are a perfect solution. I expect them to improve over time. I’d love your comments!</p>

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>

  <style>
    ul li {
      margin-top: 12px;
    }
  </style>

  <ul>

  <li><b>Always check in with any person who could plausibly be an author</b> or feel like they should be, <i>even if you disagree</i>. Never have authorship or authorship order be decided behind closed doors or without giving people an opportunity to advocate for themselves.</li>

  <li><b>Err on the side of sharing credit.</b> Credit isn’t zero sum. It is often in everyone’s benefit to be generous with credit, because it creates an incentive for others to help in the future. It also makes sense to be risk-averse to the possibility of not crediting someone who deserves it, because the harm of not crediting someone who deserves it is often greater than the harm of crediting someone who doesn't deserve it.</li>

  <li><b>Acknowledge anyone you can remember talking to</b> about your research significantly. It costs nothing and builds good will. You can still use stronger language to highlight people who helped you more.</li>

  <li><b>Don’t reveal someone else’s work or merge it into your own without their consent.</b> </li>

  <li><b>Remember that you are likely overestimating your own contributions.</b></li>

  <li><b>Act in ways that will make people want to work with you.</b> Enthusiastic collaborators are one of the most precious thing you can have as a researcher.</li>

  </ul>


  <h2>Pre-commit yourself to treating others well.</h2>

  <p>Any place you can pre-commit yourself to treating others well is an opportunity. It protects you against accidentally hurting someone and also against others worrying that you might hurt them.</p>

  <ul>

  <li><b>Mention collaborators when sending emails about your work or speaking publicly.</b> This is especially important if you are communicating with leadership or PR.</li>

  <li><b>In drafts, put “author order not finalized” under author list</b>, use a collective authorship as a placeholder, don’t list authors, etc. This avoids an appearance that you’ve unilaterally determined the authorship order and creates a natural reminder to have a conversation about authorship.</li>

  <li><b>In drafts, keep a running list of people to acknowledge.</b> This reduces the risk of you forgetting to acknowledge someone. It also signals to them that you’re taking this stuff seriously.</li>

  </ul>


  <h2>Author Contributions / Order</h2>

  <p>Authorship order can be a tricky topic. It often helps to make credit distribution more nuanced, flexible, and continuous.</p>

  <ul>

  <li><b>Consider an “Author Contributions Statement”</b> in multi-author papers saying what each author did. This is standard practice in many academic fields and required by many academic journals (eg. Nature, PLoS). Often, authors make contributions of different kinds and different magnitudes. A contributions statement can distribute credit much more fairly than authorship order. It allows much more flexible and continuous distributions of credit, which often makes things less contentious. It can also reduce “honorary authorship” problems, where senior people are on papers they didn’t contribute to, by surfacing their level of involvement.</li>

  <!--<li>Writing an author contributions statement may sound contentious, if you imagine having </li> -->

  <li><b>Write a contributions statement everyone agrees with before discussing author order.</b> Writing a contributions statement is often easier and more cooperative than discussing authorship order, because it’s more flexible, more objective, and in a strange way positive sum. (It’s also less zero sum in a strange way, because people are often attached to getting credit for particular things they did that feel important to them, and because listing all the work makes it feel like there’s more credit to go around.) It helps build empathy for the contributions others made, reduces the stakes of authorship order (because it matters less with a contributions statement), and gives a common starting point for a conversation.</li>

  <li><b>Understand people’s underlying motivations and needs.</b> If people disagree on authorship, it may help to understand what each person actually cares about. Sometimes this isn’t actually a particular author position, but making sure that they get credit within an organization, or with someone they really respect. Sometimes there’s a pragmatic reason why someone really needs a particular position.</li>

  <li><b>If there are multiple “primary” authors consider joint first authorship, randomization, or both.</b></li>

  <li><b>If you can’t find an order all authors feel good about, consider a mediated conversation or escalation.</b></li>

  </ul>


  <h2>Mediation / Escalation</h2>

  <ul>
  <li><b>In cases of conflict, involve a neutral third party.</b> This is ideally the Lowest Common Manager, or independent respected researchers who are willing to give advice or facilitate conversations on attribution situations.</li>

  <li><b>It’s essential for the third party to be neutral.</b> A perception that the conflict was adjudicated by a biased party can make things worse.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Situations to Look Out For</h2>

  Be especially careful if any of the following risk factors are present:

  <ul>
    <li>Borrowing or building on unpublished work.</li>
    <li>Collaborators involved in early parts of a project or closely related projects, but not the published result.</li>
    <li>Loss/destruction of code history (eg. submitting code written by someone else).</li>
    <li>Contributions from people who will not be authors.</li>
    <li>Aggregating multiple projects into a single larger one without aggregating authorship.</li>
    <li>Collaborators being in a condition where they can’t advocate for their interests (eg. sick, on holiday, dealing with an emergency).</li>
    <li>Remote collaborations, or collaborations with people who have left your group.</li>
    <li>Revealing any part of the project publicly for the first time, such as by open-sourcing related code, or giving a talk about it.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Citing others</h2>

  Citation serves an important dual role: helping readers find related work, and allocating credit within the research community. This second role makes it important to handle well: it can genuinely affect people’s careers.

  <ul>
  <li><b>Cite all work you significantly build on.</b> This includes infrastructure, such as Theano, Pytorch, TensorFlow, R, or Genome Analysis Toolkit. It can also involve data such as ImageNet.</li>

  <li><b>Citation is still necessary when there isn’t a “paper version” of something.</b> If they helped or influenced your work, cite blog posts, artifacts such as code, private correspondence, or unpublished work. (This is what BibTeX <code>@misc</code> is for.)</li>

  <li><b>Citation is especially important if work isn't highly cited or the author is junior.</b> </li>

  <li><b>Getting citation right is especially important in review papers.</b> </li>
  </ul>
